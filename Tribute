      <h3> Bro-science</h3>
        <p> Eggs are the breast. The yolk is like a multi-vitamin and they are a cholesterol bomb which is definitely good for the wedding tackle. 
        An unlimited way to prepare them that are all delicious so you kinda of suck if you don't like eggs. Chickens were gonna perionate them shits anyway so why not eat them? 
        They remain one of the few foods you can eat in its entirety in any state (including shell) so long as you trust the overall quality of your eggs. Raw with warm milk and honey
        got Marilyn Monroe all thickums and 20+ eggs scrambled is why they call me Manos. From a cost perspective they are one of the absolute lowest 
        cost per gram of protein foods available all while having a better nutrient profile than skinless chicken so again Chad bro, if you have a blender
        bottle you need more eggs bro. </p>
